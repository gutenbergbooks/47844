<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Most boys have a fondness for forming collections of various
objects, such as Foreign Stamps, Crests, and Coins; but very few
comparatively collect Natural Objects. Now it will be admitted
by all that the collecting of Natural Objects, such as Insects, Shells,
Plants, Fossils, Minerals, etc., possesses immense advantages over
that of Foreign Stamps and the like; for the former, besides
satisfying the collecting ambitions, also cultivates the observant
and intellectual faculties, while at the same time affording healthful
recreation in the fields and woods.</p>

<p>Again, a mere collector's province may be exhausted in a few
years, whereas the study and observation of Natural History,
which are the usual "fruits" of collecting Natural Objects, are
practically inexhaustible.</p>

<p>Another great advantage which Natural History possesses, is
that it may be prosecuted with very little expense, and is therefore
a subject which even the poorest person may conveniently undertake.</p>

<p>This little handbook is intended to be a "Guide to Collecting
Insects," which by way of Natural History, we may remark, is
becoming more popular every day in this country. Hitherto,
however, there have been very few books published on Entomology
for beginners, but for those who wish to go more deeply into the
subject than the present brief manual can pretend, we would strongly
recommend them to obtain Mr. Kirby's excellent illustrated "Text-Book
of Entomology" (Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co.), to which
work we are greatly indebted for much valuable and interesting
information.</p>

<h2 id="INTRO">INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>By the Linn√¶an system insects are divided into seven great
Natural Orders&mdash;namely, Coleoptera, Orthoptera, Neuroptera,
Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, and Diptera.</p>

<p>Of these, the Lepidoptera or Butterflies and Moths, and the
Coleoptera or Beetles, have hitherto received the lion's share of
attention, though this is less exclusively the case than it was some
few years ago.</p>

<p>Any one who wishes to commence the study of these two orders
now will have to work very hard indeed before he can hope to
put anything new on record concerning them. There is, however,
a very wide field for research and discovery open to all
who will turn their attention to the other groups, and it is with
the intention of encouraging the study of these "Neglected
Orders" that we have written the present little handbook.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The orders which we here intend to treat of are the following:&mdash;</p>


<p class="hi"><a href="#HYME"><i>The Hymenoptera</i></a>, including the Bees, Wasps, Ants, Saw
Flies, Gall Flies, Ichneumon Flies, and their allies.</p>

<p class="hi"><a href="#NEURO"><i>The Neuroptera</i></a>, including the Dragon Flies, Day Flies, Lacewing
Flies, Stone Flies, Caddis Flies, and their allies.</p>

<p class="hi"><a href="#ORTHO"><i>The Orthoptera</i></a>, including the Grasshoppers, Locusts, Crickets,
Cockroaches, Earwigs, and their allies.</p>

<p class="hi"><a href="#HEMIP"><i>The Hemiptera</i></a>, including the Bugs, Skaters, Lantern Flies,
Frog Hoppers, Aphides, and their allies.</p>

<p class="hi"><a href="#DIPTERA"><i>The Diptera</i></a>, including the Gnats, Midges, Crane Flies, Hawk
Flies, Bee Flies, Breeze Flies, Bot Flies, and their allies.</p>

<p>The number of insects is so large (about 13,000 different kinds
are found in our own country alone) that it will be found impossible
by any one to collect the whole at once; and to study them all is
completely out of the question. A single insect, indeed, is ample
to occupy a whole lifetime in the elucidation of its life history.
Most persons, when they commence to study insects, collect
indiscriminately everything which comes in their way; but they
soon find the subject too immense for them to grasp as a whole,
and they either give up collecting altogether, or else confine their
attention to a single group or order of insects. We would recommend
every young person to make up his mind at the first which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
group or groups of insects he has a special fondness or liking for.
Having done so, he will require to know the best means of attaining
his object&mdash;namely, the formation of a collection. A few
hints, therefore, as to the mode of collecting and preserving
insects in general may be of assistance to the young collector.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 3.&mdash;Aph√¶na Amabilis.</div>
</div>

<p>First of all, as to the apparatus necessary for collecting insects.</p>

<p>This will be found very simple and inexpensive. A butterfly
net is, perhaps, the most useful requisite. An ordinary cane-gauze
net will do well. A good stock of chip pill-boxes will also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
be needed. These can be purchased from the shop of any Natural
History dealer at about 3<i>d.</i> per dozen, nested (in four sizes).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_012b.jpg" width="450" height="363" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 4.&mdash;Orthesia Urtic√¶ (Mag.)</div>
</div>



<p>For collecting aquatic insects and their <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> we shall require a
water net, made of fine zinc-gauze, about six inches in diameter,
to group about among stones and other rubbish at the bottom of
pools and ditches. This instrument should be made so as to
slip on and off a walking-stick when required.</p>

<p>A killing bottle charged with cyanide of potassium or with
chopped laurel leaves completes the outfit.</p>

<p>Little need be said as regards the mode of collecting insects,
as their habits may be gathered from the following pages.</p>

<p>They may be found almost everywhere, in woods, fields, gardens,
in pools, ditches, canals, and rivers, under dead leaves and
the bark of trees, among moss and stones, etc., etc. They may
also be found at all times of the year; even in the depth of
winter some species may be met with.</p>

<p>Most insects may be preserved in the same manner as Butterflies
and Moths. They should be set on flat setting-boards, and
left to dry thoroughly before being removed.</p>

<p>The smaller species may be gummed to cardboard in a similar
way to Beetles.</p>

<p>In the arrangement of the insects in the cabinet the classification
and order given in these pages may be followed. About
half-a-dozen of each species will be found a convenient number to
collect.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hymenoptera</i> belongs to one of the most interesting and
extensive orders of insects. The structure and habits of the
different species which it includes are very various. Their marvellous
instincts have excited the admiration and wonderment of
the philosophers of all ages. They are, indeed, by far the most
intelligent of insects, being greatly in advance of any other group
known to exist. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hymenoptera</i> are mandibulate insects, their
mouths being formed for biting, and they undergo complete
metamorphoses. Perhaps the most striking external distinctive
character is to be found in the structure of the wings, both pairs
of which are membranous; and another peculiarity of equal
importance is the condition of the prothorax, which is reduced to
very small dimensions. In the majority of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hymenoptera</i> the
females are provided with stings, which serve many purposes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
independently of weapons of defence. Many families, however,
do not possess stings.</p>

<p>Many of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hymenoptera</i> feed on plants and trees, but probably
the greater number are parasitic on other insects.</p>

<p>This order includes the bees, wasps, ants, saw flies, gall flies,
ichneumon flies, and many other familiar insects.</p>

<p>The following will show the principal characteristics of each
group into which the order has been divided.</p>

<p class="hi"><a href="#ACU"><i>Tribe 1, Aculeata.</i></a>&mdash;Generally social insects, consisting of
males, females, and neuters. Ovipositor modified into
a sting. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Larv√¶</i>, footless grubs.</p>

<p class="hi"><a href="#ENTOMO"><i>Tribe 2, Entomophaga.</i></a>&mdash;Mostly parasitic on the eggs and
larv√¶ of other insects. Ovipositor used as a borer.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Larv√¶</i>, footless grubs.</p>

<h3><a id="ACU"></a><span class="smcap">Tribe I.&mdash;Aculeata.</span></h3>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aculeata</i> contains the great majority of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hymenoptera</i>.
Their principal characteristic is that the ovipositor of the female
in most of the groups is modified into a sting. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> are
footless grubs. This tribe is divided into four sections, which are
again subdivided into seventeen families, each of which it is our
intention to discuss in their proper order.</p>


<h4><a id="ANTHO"></a><i>Section 1.&mdash;Anthophila.</i></h4>

<p><a id="FAM1"></a><i>Family 1, Aphid√¶.</i>&mdash;This family contains the numerous species
of honey bees which are familiar to all of us. They are very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
varied in their structure, colours, and habits. Many species are
social, while many others are solitary. The common Hive Bee
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Apis mellifica</i>) belongs to the former class. There is, perhaps,
no insect which has attracted so much notice as this species.
Volumes have been written respecting it, and philosophers in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
ages of the world's history have spent their whole lifetime in the
elucidation of its economy.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 9.&mdash;Apis Mellifica (Drone).</div>
</div>

<p>In southern Europe, notably in Italy, a much brighter-coloured
and finer insect is found, distinguished especially by having yellow
transverse bands on the abdomen. This bee was long supposed
to be a distinct species, and was described under the name of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Apis ligustica</i>, but it is now regarded as merely a variety. This
bee has been introduced into all the northern parts of Europe.</p>

<img src="images/i_018b.jpg" width="250" height="179" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 10.&mdash;Apis Mellifica (Worker).</div>
</div>

<p>Several species of Humble Bees are very common in this
country. One of the best known is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bombus terrestris</i>, the
large females of which may attain a length of nearly an inch.
This is a large black insect with the extremity yellow.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_018c.jpg" width="250" height="209" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 11.&mdash;Melipona Anthidioides (Mag.)</div>
</div>

<p>In another rather smaller species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bombus lucorum</i>, the extremity
of the abdomen is white. Both these species are subterranean
bees, forming their nests in banks, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the moss-builders, the best known, perhaps, is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bombus
muscorum</i>, the largest specimens of which measure about two-thirds
of an inch long.</p>

<p>Another species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bombus lapidarius</i>, is so called from a preference
it shows for making its nests under stones. The end of
the abdomen of this bee is bright orange-red.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_019a.jpg" width="250" height="190" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 12.&mdash;Bombus Pratorum.</div>
</div>

<p>Of the solitary bees a very common black species is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthophora
acervorum</i>, which is usually found in abundance in the spring in the
neighbourhood of banks and cliffs.</p>

<p>The violet Carpenter Bee (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Xylocopa violacea</i>), which chiefly
inhabits the south of Europe, is a very pretty insect with violet-coloured
wings.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_019b.jpg" width="300" height="205" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 13.&mdash;Xylocopa Violacea.</div>
</div>

<p>The Mason Bee (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chalicodoma muraria</i>) builds its nest, composed
of fine grains of sand, very firmly united by a salivary
secretion, upon the surface of walls and similar situations. This
species has hitherto not been met with in this country.</p>

<p>The Horned Bee (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Osmia bicornis</i>) is remarkable for the female
having two little horns projecting from the front of her head.
This insect usually burrows in sandy banks and cliffs. Another
allied species (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Osmia hirta</i>) burrows in wood, whilst two others
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Osmia bicolor</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aurulenta</i>) select ready-made nests in the
shells of the common snails (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Helix hortensis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. nemoralis</i>),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
within the whorls of which they build their cells of gnawed
vegetable material.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 14.&mdash;Ctenioschelus Latreillii.</div>
</div>

<p>The Leaf-cutting Bees, which belong to the genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Megachile</i>, are
also very interesting in their habits.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 16.&mdash;Andrena Collaris.</div>
</div>

<p><a id="FAM2"></a><i>Family 2, Andrenid√¶.</i>&mdash;All the insects belonging to this family
are solitary in their habits. The species are very numerous in
this country. Many of them burrow in the ground, while others
have been observed to make their nests in bramble stick. They
are usually smooth, black insects, very unlike bees in appearance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
The females have no apparatus for carrying pollen either on the
legs or on the abdomen.</p>


<h4><a id="DIPLO"></a><i>Section 2.&mdash;Diploptera.</i></h4>

<p><a id="FAM3"></a><i>Family 3, Vespid√¶.</i>&mdash;The Social Wasps, which belong to this
family, are very well known everywhere in this country. In their
general structure they resemble the bees, but are usually much
more slender in appearance, and also much less hairy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_021a.jpg" width="300" height="239" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 17.&mdash;Polistes Gallica.</div>
</div>

<p>The general habits of these wasps are pretty uniform except in
the matter of their architecture, and in this respect they display a
remarkable variety.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_021b.jpg" width="300" height="345" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 18.&mdash;Nest of Polistes Gallica.</div>
</div>

<p>Besides the common Wasp (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vespa vulgaris</i>) two other species
found in this country, which build their nests in the ground,
follow the same principles in the construction of their nests.</p>

<p>The Hornet (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vespa crabo</i>), which is remarkable for its large
size, usually builds its nest in the hollow of a tree. Both the
hornet and common wasp sometimes build their nests under the
eaves of houses or attached to a beam under the roof; and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
these cases the outer covering of the nest is thinner and more
delicate in texture than when the dwelling is exposed to the
vicissitudes of the weather. Another common species inhabiting
Britain is the Wood Wasp (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vespa sylvestris</i>), which builds nests
suspended from the branches of trees.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_022a.jpg" width="250" height="177" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 19.&mdash;Odynerus Ovalis (Mag.)</div>
</div>

<p><a id="FAM4"></a><i>Family 4, Eumenid√¶.</i>&mdash;One of the commonest and best-known
species belonging to this family is the Wall Wasp (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Odynerus
parietum</i>), which may be almost constantly seen haunting sunny
walls during the months of June and July. It makes its burrows
in walls and high banks, while many other allied species form
their nests in the hollow stems of brambles.</p>

<p><a id="FAM5"></a><i>Family 5, Masarid√¶.</i>&mdash;This family contains the great bulk of
the solitary wasps, which, however, are principally inhabitants of
warm climates.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Masarid√¶</i> are a small group of black-yellow belted wasps,
which are found in the south of Europe, but not in Britain, two of
the commonest species being <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Celonites apiformis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ceramius
fonscolombi</i>.</p>


<h4><a id="FOSSO"></a><i>Section 3.&mdash;Fossores.</i></h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_022b.jpg" width="250" height="189" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 20.&mdash;Cerceris Capito.</div>
</div>

<p><a id="FAM6"></a><i>Family 6, Philanthid√¶.</i>&mdash;Most of the species belonging to this
family are black with yellow spots and bands, and most of them
are inhabitants of the warmer parts of the earth. Some of the
species provision their nests with beetles and grasshoppers, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
others attack bees, and are very mischievous, destroying great
numbers.</p>

<p><a id="FAM7"></a><i>Family 7, Crabronid√¶.</i>&mdash;This family includes a considerable
number of solitary species of wasps. In colour they are generally
black spotted and striped with yellow, but many of them are
bright red.</p>

<p>The typical genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crabro</i> is a very extensive one, including
over 150 species, a great proportion of which are inhabitants of
Europe, while even Britain possesses more than thirty.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crabro cribrarius</i> is the largest British species. Its food consists
principally of gnats and other dipterous insects. This insect
and many others burrow in the ground, generally in hard sandbanks.
Another species (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crabro brevis</i>) frequents similar situations,
and has been known to provision its nest with small
beetles.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_023.jpg" width="300" height="308" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 21.&mdash;Chlorion Viridi√¶neum.</div>
</div>

<p><a id="FAM8"></a><i>Family 8, Nyssonid√¶.</i>&mdash;This family is not a numerous one
comparatively.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mellinus arvensis</i> is a black insect, about half an inch in length,
with stripes on the abdomen and yellow legs. It provisions its
nest with flies, and not being able to capture them by swiftness,
runs past them when they are resting in an unconcerned manner
till they are thrown off their guard, when they are pounced upon
and carried off to the nest.</p>

<p><a id="FAM9"></a><i>Family 9, Larrid√¶.</i>&mdash;This family very much resembles the
last. The species are mostly small insects, few of them measuring
half an inch in length. They are usually black, sometimes with
the abdomen red at the base.</p>

<p><a id="FAM10"></a><i>Family 10, Sphegid√¶.</i>&mdash;Most of the insects included in this
family feed upon grasshoppers, and the manner in which they
procure their prey is very curious. In attacking their bulky prey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
they use every endeavour to turn the grasshopper on its back.
When they succeed in this they inflict stings in different parts of
the underside of the abdomen and thorax, which soon paralyse
the victim, which is then dragged to the nest of the ruthless
destroyer.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphex flavipennis</i> is a common species in the south of Europe.</p>

<p><a id="FAM11"></a><i>Family 11, Pompilid√¶.</i>&mdash;Most of the species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pompilus</i>
burrow in sand or sandy soil, and store their nests with spiders
and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> of insects.</p>

<p>One of our commonest species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pompilus fuscus</i>, is usually about
half an inch long, and is black, with the first three segments of
the abdomen red banded with black. This insect makes its
appearance in the spring, and may be observed in sandy places
throughout the summer. Another common British species is
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pompilus punctum</i>, which is black in colour.</p>

<p><a id="FAM12"></a><i>Family 12, Bombicid√¶.</i>&mdash;This small family is not represented in
Britain, though found in southern Europe. Many of the insects
burrow in the sand, scratching a hole with their forefeet like a
dog, as observed by Sir S. Saunders in the Ionian Islands. In
the daytime they may be seen flying rapidly from flower to flower,
and many of them exhale an odour of roses.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_024.jpg" width="300" height="249" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 22.&mdash;Sapyya Clavicornis.</div>
</div>

<p><a id="FAM13"></a><i>Family 13, Sapygid√¶.</i>&mdash;This is a small family containing only
a single genus, with very few species.</p>

<p>The species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sapyga</i> occur in Europe and North America.
They are supposed to be parasitic in the nests of bees, but the
females of the common European species (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sapyga pacca</i>) have
been observed carrying small caterpillars, from which Mr. Smith
(the great authority on Hymenoptera) justly infers that they are
parasitic only to the extent of usurping the burrows made in
sandbanks and dead wood by more industrious insects, their own
structure not adapting them for the labour of digging.</p>

<p><a id="FAM14"></a><i>Family 14, Scoliid√¶.</i>&mdash;Although this family is abundant in warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
climates, we have only two small species belonging to the genus
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tiphia</i> in Britain.</p>

<p>They are black, with more or less reddish legs, and measure
from a quarter to half an inch in length. In south Europe we
meet with several large and handsome species, one of which,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scolia hortorum</i>, is black with two yellow bands on the abdomen.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_025a.jpg" width="350" height="224" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 23.&mdash;Scolia Hortorum.</div>
</div>

<p><a id="FAM15"></a><i>Family 15, Thymid√¶.</i>&mdash;The insects of this family are almost
exclusively confined to Australia and South America, where they
are very numerous. They are generally of a black colour, with
more or less extended yellow markings. They are very stout
insects; in fact, their bloated bodies give them very little resemblance
to any other insects, except perhaps to the Oil Beetles.
Very little has hitherto been ascertained respecting their habits,
but they are believed to be parasitic.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_025b.jpg" width="250" height="177" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 24.&mdash;Mutilla Maura (Male).</div>
</div>

<p><a id="FAM16"></a><i>Family 16, Mutillid√¶.</i>&mdash;This family includes a large number
of species, probably 1,500, but from the differences presented by
the males and females, entomologists have found it difficult to
arrive at any certainty upon this point. The species are spread
over all the earth, but are particularly abundant in warm climates,
where also, as usual, they attain the largest size and the most
beautiful colouring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the best-known species in our own country is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mutilla
europ√¶a</i>, which is about half an inch long, of a black colour, hairy,
with the thorax entirely red in the wingless females.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_026a.jpg" width="200" height="192" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 25.&mdash;Mutilla Maura (Female).</div>
</div>

<p>This insect frequents the nests of Humble Bees, and its <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i>
appear to be parasitic upon the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> of the bees.</p>


<h4><a id="HETERO"></a><i>Section 4.&mdash;Heterogyna.</i></h4>

<p><a id="FAM17"></a><i>Family 17, Formicid√¶.</i>&mdash;To this family belongs the numerous
species of ants, which are social insects, organised after the fashion
of the bees and social wasps.</p>

<p>The number of species described is probably considerably over
a thousand, but the total number must be very much greater if
Mr. Bates is correct in his estimate that not less than 400 species
inhabit the valley of the Amazon.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_026b.jpg" width="250" height="306" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 26.&mdash;Formica Lignipeda (Male). (Mag.)</div>
</div>

<p>The habits of the ants are most interesting, and one of our
greatest living naturalists, Sir John Lubbock, has devoted much
of his time in elucidating their economy.</p>

<p>The nests are almost always chambered cavities, hollowed out
either in the ground, in walls, and similar situations, or in dead
and decaying wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the commonest examples in our own country is the
Garden Ant (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Formica nigra</i>), which may be found everywhere
in gardens making its nest in the ground.</p>

<p>Another common species is the pretty Turf Ant (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Formica flava</i>),
which generally haunts commons and heaths, casting up small
hills, which serve to throw off the rain; and this species in some
localities makes its nest under stones. The Wood Ant (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Formica
lignipeda</i>) is another familiar species.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 27.&mdash;Formica Lignipeda (Worker). (Mag.)</div>
</div>

<p>A very large group of ants belong to the section <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Myrmicin√¶</i>,
the best-known species of which are the Red Ants, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Myrmica rubra</i>,
and their allies.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 28.&mdash;Myrmica Rubra (Male). (Mag.)</div>
</div>

<p>A very minute species which has been introduced into this
country, probably from Brazil or the West Indies, is the Horse
Ant (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Myrmica molesta</i>). It is a very small brownish-yellow
species, which seems to have been first observed in England in
1828. It takes up its abode in houses, frequently in the neighbourhood
of the kitchen fireplace, and when it multiplies becomes
such a pest as to render the house uninhabitable. Some of the
metropolitan districts have been particularly infested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>


<h3><a id="ENTOMO"></a><span class="smcap">Tribe II.&mdash;Entomophaga.</span></h3>

<p>Most of the insects belonging to this tribe are parasitic on other
insects. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> are footless. There are seven families included
in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Entomophaga</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><a id="FAM18"></a><i>Family 18, Cynipid√¶.</i>&mdash;This family includes most of the gall
flies. The number of species is very considerable. Of the great
majority the females pierce with their ovipositor the tissues of
plants and trees, and there deposit their eggs, from which the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> are soon hatched. The irritation caused by this intrusion
of a foreign body into the tissues produces the galls which are so

<p>The galls produced by different species of flies differ greatly
in form and structure. Some of them are round and smooth, like
fruits, such as the cherry gall of the oak leaves, produced by the
puncture of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cynips quercus-foli</i>.</p>

<p>The most singular, however, of all the galls is perhaps the
Bedeguar, which is formed on the stems of wild roses by the puncture
of a small species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rhodites ros√¶</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p><a id="FAM19"></a><i>Family 19, Chalcidid√¶.</i>&mdash;To this family belong many gall insects,
principally found, however, in foreign countries.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chalcidid√¶</i> include a great number of small species, few
exceeding half an inch in expanse. Many of these are singular
in shape, and others brilliantly metallic; but, owing to their small
size, they have hitherto been studied by comparatively few
entomologists.</p>

<p><a id="FAM20"></a><i>Family 20, Proctotrypid√¶.</i>&mdash;The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Proctotrypid√¶</i> are probably
much less numerous than the preceding family, but have been less
studied, being generally smaller and more obscure in their habits;
in fact, some of them share with several beetles the reputation of
being the smallest insects.</p>

<p><a id="FAM21"></a><i>Family 21, Braconid√¶.</i>&mdash;This family is one of very great
extent.</p>

<p>Many of the foreign species are rather large and handsome
insects, often varied with black and yellow.</p>

<p>The best known of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Braconid√¶</i> is perhaps <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Microgaster glomeratus</i>,
a small blackish species with reddish-yellow legs, which
destroys the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> of the common Cabbage Butterflies, round
the dead body of which its little yellow cocoons may often be
observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p><a id="FAM22"></a><i>Family 22, Ichneumonid√¶.</i>&mdash;The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ichneumonid√¶</i> are rather large

<p>They are a very numerous group. It has been calculated that
nearly 5,000 species have been described, but the data generally
are very untrustworthy.</p>

<p>In another group, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pimplin√¶</i>, the ovipositor is generally very
long. The best-known species is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rhyssa persuasoria</i>, a blackish
insect, which measures about an inch in length. This insect is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
met with in fir plantations, and uses its extraordinary ovipositor
to drill holes in trees infested by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sirex gigas</i>, on
which its own <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larva</i> is parasitic. The insect frequently drives
its ovipositor so firmly into the wood of the tree, that it is unable
to withdraw it, and perishes in this position.</p>

<p><a id="FAM23"></a><i>Family 23, Evaniid√¶.</i>&mdash;One of the most familiar insects belonging
to this family is the <i>Evania appendigaster</i>. It is a small
black insect, found in the south of Europe, and is parasitic on
cockroaches. An allied British species, <i>F&oelig;nus jaculator</i>, is a
not uncommon insect found haunting the burrows of <i>Crabronid√¶</i>,
upon which it is probably parasitic.</p>

<p><a id="FAM24"></a><i>Family 24, Chrysidid√¶.</i>&mdash;The Ruby-tailed Wasps, or Golden
Wasps, as the <i>Chrysidid√¶</i> are popularly called, are among the most
brilliant of the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, most of the species being either of an
intense green, blue, or fiery red.</p>

<p>They are small or moderate-sized insects, which are found on
walls or flowers in the full heat of the sun; for, as a rule, the most
brilliantly-coloured insects are diurnal in their habits.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 37.&mdash;Chrysis Ignita (Mag.)</div>
</div>

<p>As far as their habits are known, they deposit their eggs in the
nests of other insects, chiefly <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hymenoptera</i>, on the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> of which
their own offspring feed.</p>

<p>The commonest British species is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chrysis ignita</i>, which is a very
variable insect, both as regards size and colouring.</p>


<h3><a id="PHYTO"></a><span class="smcap">Tribe III.&mdash;Phytophaga.</span></h3>

<p>The insects belonging to the third tribe of the Hymenoptera are
strictly vegetable feeders. There are only two families.</p>

<p><a id="FAM25"></a><i>Family 25, Siricid√¶.</i>&mdash;This family includes the insects known
as Tailed Wasps. It is not a very extensive family, and its species
occur chiefly in Europe and North America, in both of which
regions the typical genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sirex</i> is represented by large species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The best-known European species which is common in some
parts of Britain is the great Tailed Wasp (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sirex gigas</i>), a very formidable-looking
insect, of which the female often measures nearly
an inch and a half in length.</p>

<img src="images/i_033a.jpg" width="350" height="210" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 38.&mdash;Cimbex Luteus.</div>
</div>

<p>The general tint is black with the antenn√¶, the sides of the
thorax and the legs and apex of the abdomen yellow. This
insect lives in pine and fir woods, and the female deposits her
eggs in the woody parts of the trees, into which she bores to a
depth of over half an inch by means of her long ovipositor.</p>

(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nematus ventricosus</i>), whose speckled and green <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> are so
injurious in gardens and orchards. This insect is yellowish in

<h2 id="NEURO">ORDER NEUROPTERA.<br />
<span class="smcap">Including the Dragon Flies, Lacewing Flies, Day Flies,
Stone Flies, Caddis Flies, and their Allies.</span></h2>


<p>Next to the butterflies and moths, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Neuroptera</i> (or nerve-winged
insects), to which belong the Dragon Flies, Lacewing Flies,
Day Flies, Stone Flies, Caddis Flies, and their allies, are undoubtedly
the most beautiful members of the insect tribe. Though they
cannot compete with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lepidoptera</i> in point of colouring, it is
questionable whether they are not more graceful and elegant in
appearance.</p>

<p>The order <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Neuroptera</i> was founded by the great Swedish
naturalist Linn√¶us, and its name has been kept intact since,
though the classification of the insects comprised in it has
undergone many modifications.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_035.jpg" width="350" height="302" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 41.&mdash;Ascacaphus Macaronius.</div>
</div>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Neuroptera</i> are not a very numerous body of insects
compared with either the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coleoptera</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lepidoptera</i>, but they
contain some of the largest and most handsome insects known.
The order is very well represented in the temperate zones, though
the finest species are met with in the tropical parts of the world.
Nearly 700 species are known to inhabit the British Isles. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
whole world their number may be given in round figures at about
4,000, but there is no doubt that this number may be considerably
increased.</p>

<p>The largest and most handsome species are the Dragon Flies or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ornoptera</i>, one species occurring in our own country, measuring
fully four inches in expanse of the wings. The Lacewing Flies
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hemerobiid√¶</i>), the Day Flies (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ephemerid√¶</i>), the Stone Flies
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Perlid√¶</i>), and the Caddis Flies (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trichoptera</i>), are among the
other more conspicuous members of the group.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_036.jpg" width="350" height="374" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 42.&mdash;Nemoptera Extensa.</div>
</div>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Neuroptera</i> may be divided into three great sub-divisions,
according to certain well-defined characteristics. The modern
tendency is to raise each of these sub-divisions to the rank of
orders.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Neuroptera</i> may be classified as follows:&mdash;</p>


<div class="ml2">
<p><a href="#PLANI"><i>Sub-Order 1, Planipennia</i></a>, or true Neuroptera.</p>

<p class="ml1">Metamorphoses complete, larv√¶, mostly terrestrial.</p>

<p><a href="#TRI"><i>Sub-Order 2, Trichoptera</i></a>, or hairy-winged Neuroptera.</p>

<p class="ml1">Metamorphoses complete, larv√¶ aquatic. Wings of
Imago clothed with hairs.</p>

<p><a href="#PSEUDO"><i>Sub-Order 3, Pseudo-Neuroptera</i></a>, or false Neuroptera.</p>

<p class="ml1">Metamorphoses incomplete.</p>
</div>

<p>The most important distinction between the first two groups
and the third is that the former undergo complete metamorphoses,
whereas in the latter the transformations are incomplete or
imperfect. The latter for this reason are often classified as a
separate order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trichoptera</i> are also placed by some entomologists in a
distinct order, on account of the peculiarity in their wings being
clothed with hairs. They, however, present so many points both
in habits and structure, analogous with the true <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Neuroptera</i>, that
we have retained them as a sub-division of the Order.</p>

which contain representatives in the British Isles. They are most

<p><a id="FAM1B"></a><i>Family 1, Myrmeleontid√¶.</i>&mdash;The Ant Lions are the most familiar
and important members of this family. The common Ant Lion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Myrmeleon europ√¶us</i>), which is abundant in sandy places in the
south of Europe, is a slender and elegant creature, with large
finely reticulated rings. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larva</i>, to which the name of
"Ant Lion" properly belongs, is of a stout form and a greyish-yellow
colour, covered with warty processes and with hairs. Its
food consists of ants and other small insects, which it captures by
a singularly ingenious arrangement, namely, by means of a funnel-shaped
pitfall which it constructs in the sand, and at the bottom
of which it lies. When any unfortunate insect ventures too near,
the Ant Lion sends up a shower of sand, and the victim in its
consternation falls down the pit, where it is speedily seized and
devoured.</p>

<p>Other species of ant lions are known to occur on the continent
of Europe, but none hitherto have been discovered to inhabit this
country.</p>

Lacewing Flies, many representatives of which occur in the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Isles. They are among the most elegant and beautiful of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Neuroptera</i>.</p>

<p>The Golden-eyed Fly (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chrysopa vulgaris</i>) is a very abundant
and well-known example, but notwithstanding its great beauty it
is capable of emitting a very disagreeable odour when handled.
This is a delicate green insect with a body half an inch long, and
which may be seen almost everywhere on warm summer evenings,
flying slowly about from tree to tree. The eggs, which are little
round or oval bodies like small pearls, are deposited by the
female in groups upon the leaves of plants and trees. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larva</i>
when fullfed is about half an inch in length. The food consists
of plant lice and aphides, and it is thus a very beneficial creature,
and should be encouraged by every gardener. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pupa</i> of this
insect is enclosed in a cocoon. Between thirty and forty species
of lacewing flies are known to occur in our own country.</p>

British Isles.</p>

<p><a id="FAM4B"></a><i>Family 4, Sialid√¶.</i>&mdash;In the fourth family of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Planipennia</i> the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> are aquatic in their habits with very few exceptions. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pupa</i> is not enclosed in a cocoon as it is in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hemerobiid√¶</i>.
The single common British species (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sialis lutaria</i>) is a blackish-brown
insect, rather more than half an inch in length. It is well
known to anglers, and may be found abundantly in the spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and early part of the summer upon walls and palings in the
neighbourhood of water, and upon the stems and leaves of grasses
and other plants growing in the water or upon its bank.</p>

<p>In repose the wings of this insect, as in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hemerolicid√¶</i>, are
laid over the back. They are sluggish creatures, and do not
readily take to flight.</p>

<p><a id="FAM5B"></a><i>Family 5, Raphiid√¶.</i>&mdash;This family contains the curious group
of insects called "Snake Flies" or "Camel Flies," which are
included by some entomologists in the previous family. They
have characteristics, however, which entitle them to be placed
apart. They have a rather large head, which is attached to a
greatly elongated prothorax by a thinnish neck, so that the head
has considerable freedom of motion. The species are not
numerous, four kinds only occurring in Britain. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i>
reside under the bark of trees, where they feed upon minute
insects. The commonest species is probably <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Raphidia megacephala</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i>, so far as they are known, live in the earth, and are
like caterpillars in their general form.</p>

<p>Five species occur in this country, the best known being
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Panorpa communis</i>, which may be met with almost everywhere
about hedge banks and in lanes. It is about half an inch long.
The wings are transparent, with dark brown spots, which are more
or less confluent.</p>

<p>Another species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Boreus hiemalis</i>, which possesses no wings, is
found on the ground among leaves in the winter time. It does
not exceed one-sixth of an inch in length, and is of a metallic-green
colour.</p>

<h3><a id="TRI"></a><span class="smcap">Sub-Order 2.&mdash;Trichoptera.</span></h3>

<p>The members of this group are the insects commonly known as
Caddis Flies, and they are often ranked as a separate order by
entomological writers.</p>

<p>Nearly 600 species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trichoptera</i> occur in Europe, of which
about half the number are indigenous to the British Isles. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> are aquatic, and when full-grown prepare for themselves
curious dwellings composed of sticks, stones, and other materials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
wherein to pass the pupa state. They may be seen almost
everywhere where there is water.</p>

<p>The caddis flies may be divided into two families, though the
distinguishing marks are so minute that they really ought to be
classified as one family only. To Mr. McLachlan we owe many
thanks for his researches in this group of insects.</p>

</div>

<p><a id="FAM1C"></a><i>Family 1, In√¶guipalpia.</i>&mdash;This family includes the largest
species of the tribe, and are principally found in northern regions.</p>

<p>One of our largest British species is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phryganea grandis</i>, which
measures four-fifths of an inch in length, and over two inches in
expanse of the wing. It is an abundant insect, of a brown colour,
with yellow rings on its <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">antenn√¶</i>, and the anterior wings are ash-coloured,
clothed with brown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> of this group for the most part inhabit quiet waters,
ponds, canals, etc.</p>

<p>This family is subdivided into three sub-families, viz., <a id="SF1"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phryganeid√¶</i>,
<a id="SF2"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Limnophilid√¶</i>, <a id="SF3"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sericostomid√¶</i>.</p>

<p><a id="FAM2C"></a><i>Family 2, √Üguipalpia.</i>&mdash;This family constitutes a second group,
and also contains many species, many of them, however, being
very minute insects, some hardly one-eighth of an inch across the
wings. They make little cases of silk resembling seeds, to the
outer surface of which they attach grains of sand, etc.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">√Üguipalpia</i> contains four sub-families&mdash;viz., <a id="SF1B"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leptocerid√¶</i>,
<a id="SF2B"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hydropsychid√¶</i>, <a id="SF3B"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rhyacophilid√¶</i>, and <a id="SF4B"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hydroptilid√¶</i>.</p>

<p>Of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leptocerid√¶</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Molanna augustata</i> may be taken as a
typical example, the larva of which lives on the sandy bottom
of pools, and is very difficult to detect.</p>


<h3><a id="PSEUDO"></a><span class="smcap">Sub-Order 3.&mdash;Pseudo-neuroptera.</span></h3>

<p>In the third sub-order of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Neuroptera</i> are grouped together
a series of insects which present great divergences of character,
and really do not belong to the true <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Neuroptera</i> on account of
their incomplete metamorphoses. They, however, for the most
part, resemble the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Neuroptera</i> in the structure of their wings.</p>

<p>They are divided into several tribes and many families.</p>


<h4><a id="ORNO"></a><span class="smcap">Tribe I.&mdash;Ornoptera or Dragon Flies.</span></h4>

<p>To this tribe belong the Dragon Flies, the largest and most
beautiful members of the whole order.</p>

<p>About 1,500 species have been described from various parts of
the world, and of these about fifty are known to inhabit our own
country.</p>

<p>Their habits are very much alike. The insect passes all the
earlier stages of its existence in water. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> are most
voracious creatures, and are undoubtedly the most predaceous of
insects. The apparatus by which they capture their prey consists
of a peculiar modification of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">labium</i>.</p>

<p>When full grown the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> crawl up the stem of some aquatic
plant out of the water, and after resting there for a longer or
shorter time the skin splits open along the thoracic region, and the
perfect insect by degrees struggles out of its investment, and
when the wings are dried it starts off to continue the same scene
of rapine which has characterised its subterranean existence.</p>

<p>The perfect insect may be seen hawking about for insects in
the neighbourhood of pools in all fine weather during the summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and autumn months. In dull weather, however, they usually remain
at rest on the leaves of plants and trees, etc. The eyes of Dragon
Flies are most beautiful objects when viewed under the microscope;
they are composed of a great number of facets or lenses. In
one species of Dragon Fly as many as 10,000 of these facets have
been counted in each of its eyes.</p>

<p>Besides these compound eyes most dragon flies have additional
eyes, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ocelli</i>, which are situated on the top of the head;
they are, however, quite simple.</p>

<p>It is commonly thought by persons who are not naturalists that
dragon flies sting; such an erroneous idea we take the opportunity
to correct.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_045.jpg" width="500" height="301" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 54.&mdash;Libellula Depressa.</div>
</div>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ornoptera</i> are divided into two principal families.</p>

<p><a id="FAM1D"></a><i>Family 1, Libellulin√¶.</i>&mdash;To this family belong all the great
dragon flies, mostly thick-bodied insects. It is subdivided into
four sub-families.</p>

<p>To the first sub-family, the <a id="SF1C"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Libellulid√¶</i>, many common and
familiar dragon flies belong. The best known is what is vulgarly
called the "Horse-stinger" (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Libellula depressa</i>), an insect about
two inches long, with a rather depressed abdomen, which is
yellowish-brown, with yellow spots on the sides in the female, and
coated with a beautiful violet-blue powder in the male.</p>

<p>It may be seen almost everywhere, hawking for flies about
rivers and ponds, during warm weather.</p>

<p>The second sub-family, the <a id="SF2C"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cordulid√¶</i>, contains four British
species, of which the beautiful <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cordulia metallica</i> is the typical
example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The <a id="SF3C"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">√Üschnid√¶</i> contain some of the largest members found.
The great dragon fly (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">√Üschna grandis</i>) is one of these. It is
nearly three inches long and four inches in expanse of the wings,
and is of a light rusty-brown colour with a few pale markings.</p>

<p>Of the <a id="SF4C"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gomphid√¶</i> only four species inhabit our own country.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gomphus vulgatissimus</i> is a black insect, nearly two inches long,
with yellow bands on the thorax, and a line of the same colour
along the back of the abdomen.</p>

<p><a id="FAM2D"></a><i>Family 2, Agronin√¶.</i>&mdash;This family contains a number of
slender-bodied insects. There are two sub-families.</p>

<p>The <a id="SF1D"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agrionid√¶</i> are a very numerous group. The typical form,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agrion puella</i>, which is a beautiful, slender creature, measures
about two or two and a half inches in expanse of the wings.
The abdomen of the male is banded with azure blue, that of the
female being brassy-black.</p>

<p>The <a id="SF2D"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calopterygid√¶</i> contain only two British species&mdash;viz.,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calopteryx virgo</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. splendens</i>.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 55.&mdash;Calopteryx Virgo (Male).</div>
</div>


<h4><a id="SUBU"></a><span class="smcap">Tribe II.&mdash;Subulicornia.</span></h4>

<p>The second tribe of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pseudo-neuroptera</i> contains a group of
insects which are so similar to one another in form that they are
all included in one family.</p>

<p><a id="FAM3D"></a><i>Family 3, Ephemerid√¶.</i>&mdash;The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ephemerid√¶</i>, or Day Flies, as they
are popularly called, are delicate, elongated, soft-bodied creatures,
with a moderately small head. The antenn√¶, which spring from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the forehead below the ocelli, are short and awl-shaped. These
insects, which seem to be found mostly in temperate climates, are
remarkable for the great delicacy of their structure, and for the
extreme shortness of their lives in the perfect state, which seems
in general scarcely to exceed a day.</p>

<p>Nearly fifty species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ephemerid√¶</i> occur in this country. The
best known is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ephemera vulgata</i>, of which the sub-imago is
called the "green drake," and the imago the "grey drake" by
anglers. The two-winged <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cl√∂en diptera</i>, which, however, is a
much smaller species than the foregoing, is also very abundant.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_047.jpg" width="450" height="364" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 56.&mdash;Calopteryx Virgo (Female).</div>
</div>


<h4><a id="PLECO"></a><span class="smcap">Tribe III.&mdash;Plecoptera.</span></h4>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plecoptera</i> contain only one family.</p>

<p><a id="FAM4D"></a><i>Family 4, Perlid√¶.</i>&mdash;The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Perlid√¶</i>, or Stone Flies, are chiefly
inhabitants of the temperate regions; they are of small size, and
not very numerous in species, about thirty being indigenous to
the British Isles.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i>, which are aquatic in their habits, closely resemble
the perfect insect in form. Their food consists of other insects
and they prey especially upon the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> of the Day Flies.</p>

<p>The perfect insects are usually found resting quietly on plants
and other objects on the banks of streams. The large brown
species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Perla bicaudata</i>, appears in the spring, and is very
common in the neighbourhood of pools, streams, and canals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>


<h4><a id="CORRO"></a><span class="smcap">Tribe IV.&mdash;Corrodentia.</span></h4>

<p>This tribe contains two families, one of which is represented in
the British Isles.</p>

<p><a id="FAM5D"></a><i>Family 5, Psocid√¶.</i>&mdash;This is a family of small insects with
simple veined wings. They have a rather large head, and bear a
pair of long tapering antenn√¶. They are found upon trunks of
trees, old palings, walls, etc. They are very active in their
movements, and generally appear in the imago state about the
end of summer or beginning of autumn.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Atropos pulsatorius</i> is one of these. It lives in books and
among old damp papers, whence it is often called the "Book
Louse."</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 58.&mdash;Psocus Bipunctatus.</div>
</div>

<p>They are also very destructive to collections of preserved
insects and plants. About thirty species occur in this country.</p>

<p><a id="FAM6D"></a><i>Family 6, Embiid√¶.</i>&mdash;This family contains no representative
in the British Isles, and consists of a small number of almost
exclusively exotic species. Two species, however, inhabit the
continent of Europe, one of which, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Embia Solieri</i>, occurs in the
south of France on the Mediterranean littoral.</p>

<p>These insects are very closely allied to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Psocid√¶</i> in their
habits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>


<h4><a id="SOCI"></a><span class="smcap">Tribe V.&mdash;Socialia.</span></h4>

<p>The Socialia contains a very peculiar group of insects closely
allied to the cockroaches in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Orthoptera</i>. They may be
considered a connecting link between that order and the
Neuroptera. There is only one family.</p>

<p><a id="FAM7D"></a><i>Family 7, Termiti√¶.</i>&mdash;The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Termiti√¶</i>, or White Ants, are almost
exclusively inhabitants of tropical climates, and are unrepresented
in our own country.</p>

<p>They are a very remarkable family of insects. They build
most complicated dwellings, consisting of innumerable galleries
and chambers, and they are so interesting in their habits that
every traveller who has seen anything of them has always a great
deal to relate concerning them.</p>

<p>One species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Termes lucifugus</i>, inhabits the south of France,
and is very well known on account of the mischief which it
sometimes causes.</p>

<h4><a id="PHY"></a><span class="smcap">Tribe VI.&mdash;Physopoda, or Thrips.</span></h4>

<p>This tribe of insects, to which the name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thysanoptera</i> is sometimes
applied, contains many curious forms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>There are two principal groups of these insects&mdash;namely, the
<a id="FAM8D"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tuberlifera</i> and the <a id="FAM9D"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Terebrantia</i>. They are generally known to
gardeners by the name of "Thrips." Some of them occasionally
prove injurious to cultivated plants. This is especially the case
with the Corn Thrips (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thrips cerealium</i>), which generally attacks
the ears of corn, and, when numerous, is very mischievous.</p>


<h4><a id="MALLO"></a><span class="smcap">Tribe VII.&mdash;Mallophaga or Bird Lice.</span></h4>

<p>These insects, which are known as "Bird Lice," were formerly
placed among the true lice, but they differ in the possession of
biting mouths, and in the diet to which such a structure adapts
them.</p>

<p>A great number of these curious little insects have been
recorded, and they inhabit all parts of the world. They live
among the feathers of birds and the hairs of mammalia.</p>

<p>Almost every animal and bird is subject to these parasites.</p>

<p>The common fowl, duck, goose, game birds of all kinds, and
pigeons, are very commonly infested by them, as are also the dog,
the cat, the sheep, and the guinea-pig.</p>

<p>The two principal families of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mallophaga</i> are the <a id="FAM10D"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Philopterid√¶</i>
and the <a id="FAM11D"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liotheid√¶</i>.</p>

<p>The forms composed in this tribe of insects are reckoned at
present to be the nearest resemblance to the theoretical progenitors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of the insects; in fact, Sir John Lubbock hints that they might
well be regarded not as insects at all, but rather as the surviving
representatives of a group formed by the ancestors of the whole
multitude of insect types.</p>

<p>Three principal families may be recognised&mdash;viz., <a id="FAM12D"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lepesmid√¶</i>,

<h4><a id="COLLE"></a><span class="smcap">Tribe IX.&mdash;Collembola or Spring Tails.</span></h4>

<p>These insects closely resemble the previous tribe in general
character, to which also the same remarks nearly apply.</p>

<p>They are generally small insects, a length of a quarter of an
inch being considerably above the average. They are found
commonly in loose earth, under decaying leaves in woods, in moss,
under the bark of dead trees, and in rotten stumps. They always
prefer damp situations.</p>

<p>Cold seems to have but little effect upon them; they will recover
their activity after being frozen. One species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Desoria glacialis</i>, is
found enjoying itself upon the Swiss glaciers, and another, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Degeeria

Some species also may be met with hopping about upon the surface
of standing water. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Podura aquatica</i>, a minute blue-black species,

<h2 id="ORTHO">ORDER ORTHOPTERA.<br />
<span class="smcap">Including the Grasshoppers, Locusts, Crickets, Cockroaches,
Earwigs, and their Allies.</span></h2>


<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Orthoptera</i> include all those forms of insects which have
four wings, the anterior pair being of a leathery nature. They
are mandibulate; that is, their mouths are formed for biting, and
they undergo an imperfect metamorphosis.</p>

<p>The insects comprised in this order are extremely numerous
and destructive in the tropical parts of the world (Kirby gives
their number as about 7,000), but they are only represented in
the British Isles by about sixty species, few of which are really
abundant. They include the cockroaches, crickets, grasshoppers,
locusts, earwigs, etc.</p>

<p>All these insects may be divided into three sub-divisions or
tribes&mdash;namely, the Runners or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cursoria</i>, the Leapers or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Saltatoria</i>,
and the Earwigs or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Euplexoptera</i>.</p>

<p>The following table will show at a glance the outlines of the
proposed arrangement:&mdash;</p>

<p class="hi"><a href="#CURSO"><i>Tribe</i> I., <i>Cursoria</i></a>.&mdash;Hind wings with veins radiating from the
base. Hind legs formed for running.</p>

<p class="hi"><a href="#SALTA"><i>Tribe</i> II., <i>Saltatoria</i></a>.&mdash;Hind wings with veins radiating from
base. Hind legs formed for leaping.</p>

<p class="hi"><a href="#EUPLE"><i>Tribe</i> III., <i>Euplexoptera</i></a>.&mdash;Hind wings with veins radiating
from the apex of a horny piece occupying the base of
the anterior margin.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Euplexoptera</i>, or Earwigs, are regarded by some authors as
a separate order. They are thus treated by Westwood in his
"Introduction to the Modern Classification of Insects," but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
modern tendency is to revert to the Linn√¶an system, and retain
them among the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Orthoptera</i>.</p>

<p>We will now proceed to describe each of these families in
turn.</p>


<h3><a id="CURSO"></a><span class="smcap">Tribe I.&mdash;Cursoria.</span></h3>

<p>The insects constituting this group are distinguished by having
their hind legs adapted for walking or running. They are subdivided
into three families.</p>

<p><a id="FAM1E"></a><i>Family 1, Blattid√¶.</i>&mdash;This family includes the numerous species
of cockroaches, or "black bats" as they are often called by
uneducated persons. They are represented in all parts of the
world, but are most abundant within the tropics, and especially in
central and southern America, where also the largest and finest
species are to be found. Many curious forms are also to be met
with in India and different parts of Africa.</p>

<p>They are very active creatures, and run with considerable
rapidity, but their activity is chiefly nocturnal, and during the day
they generally remain quietly concealed in some obscure retreat.
Their diet consists of both vegetable and animal matter, and offal
of every description. They are most useful in hot climates, acting
the part of scavengers, and by these means preventing the outbreak
of malaria and other pestilential diseases.</p>

<p>The best-known species in this country is the common Cockroach
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Blatta orientalis</i>), which, by-the-bye, is not a native of
Europe, having been introduced from the East several centuries
ago, and to have made its home here.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_055.jpg" width="350" height="320" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 66.&mdash;Blatta Orientalis.</div>
</div>

<p>Other species besides this are met with occasionally in different
parts of the country, having been introduced in like manner at <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
different times from foreign parts. The Giant Cockroach (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Blaberus
giganteus</i>) is one of these. Its native home is South America and
the West Indies, and in the latter place it is commonly called
the "drummer." It measures nearly three inches in length.
The Zoological Gardens in London is a favourite resort of this
species.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_056a.jpg" width="500" height="358" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 67.&mdash;Blaberus Giganteus.</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_056b.jpg" width="250" height="325" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 68.&mdash;Corydia Petiveriana.</div>
</div>

<p><a id="FAM2E"></a><i>Family 2, Mantid√¶.</i>&mdash;The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mantid√¶</i> may be at once distinguished
from the insects comprising the other two families of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cursoria</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
by the structure of the forelegs, which are converted into powerful
raptoral organs.</p>

<p>The body of these insects is more or less elongated, and the
head, which is triangular or heart-shaped, is attached to the
thorax by a distinct neck.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_057.jpg" width="500" height="458" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 69.&mdash;Blepharis Mendica.</div>
</div>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mantid√¶</i>, or Praying Insects, are celebrated for their habit
of resting on their four hind legs, and with their front legs raised
in the air, in what was formerly supposed to be an attitude of
devotion, but really in an observant attitude, and on the alert for
their prey.</p>

<p>None of these insects are met with in the British Isles, but
several species are rather abundant in the south of France. Two
species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mantis pauperata</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mantis religosa</i>, measure about two
or two and a half inches in length. A third species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mantis
oratoria</i>, is also common but somewhat smaller in size.</p>

<p><a id="FAM3E"></a><i>Family 3, Phasmid√¶.</i>&mdash;These insects very much resemble the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mantid√¶</i> in general appearance, to which also they are very closely
allied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>They are among the most peculiar insects in existence. Their
appearance is comical in the extreme. Many of them resemble
sticks, either green growing trees or brown and withered branches,
and hence the name of stick insects commonly applied to them is
very appropriate. On account of their skeleton-like forms they
have also been likened to ghosts and spectres.</p>

<p>Some few species mimic leaves of trees and various plants,
and these are often called "leaf insects."</p>

<p>The number of species of this family is not very large, and by
far the greater part of these are inhabitants of the warmer regions
of the earth, and they seem to increase in size, especially the
nearer their home lies to the Equator.</p>

<p>Among the more interesting species we may mention <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyphocrania
semirubra</i> from Brazil, with short greenish elytra and pink
wings.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bacillus rosii</i> is a brown, wingless form found in Italy and the
south of France.</p>

<p>Some of the tropical species are among the largest insects known.
A winged Australian species attains the length of ten inches.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lopaphus cocophagus</i> is a common species in the South Sea
Islands, and sometimes commits great ravages in the plantations
of cocoa-nut trees. When this insect is alarmed it squirts out a
highly acrid fluid, which causes great pain, and sometimes blindness
if it reaches the eye.</p>

<p>We may remark that no species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phasmid√¶</i> are known to
inhabit the British Isles.</p>


<h3><a id="SALTA"></a><span class="smcap">Tribe II.&mdash;Saltatoria.</span></h3>

<p>The principal character of the insects belonging to this tribe
consists in the adaptation of the hind legs to the purpose of
leaping.</p>

<p>The males of most of the species possess the faculty of producing
loud chirping sounds, but the means by which this is
effected vary in the different families.</p>

<p><a id="FAM4E"></a><i>Family 4, Achetid√¶.</i>&mdash;The most familiar British insect belonging
to this family is the common House Cricket (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acheta domestica</i>).
Living, as it does, in the immediate vicinity of the fire, it seems
to be totally independent of the changes of the seasons, and may
usually be found of all ages at all periods of the year. Crickets
are particularly abundant in bakehouses, being extremely partial
to warmth. The chirping noise which they produce at night-time
is sometimes almost deafening, and it is really surprising from
what a very long distance the sound may be heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Their food consists of bread crumbs and scraps of meat and
vegetables which have been allowed to accumulate during the
daytime. The best way, therefore, to get rid of the insects is to
take proper care in clearing away all the refuse after meals, for if
this were not there the crickets could not subsist, and would soon
quit the house. They are, however, generally objected to only by
weak-nerved people, and do very little harm, if any whatever. It
is a question whether they are not very useful in acting as
scavengers.</p>

<img src="images/i_059b.jpg" width="400" height="404" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 71.&mdash;Gryllotalpa Vulgaris.</div>
</div>

<p>A nearly allied British species is the Field Cricket (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acheta campestris</i>),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
which is rather larger than the house cricket. It is
comparatively rare and local in this country, but abounds everywhere
on the Continent.</p>

<p>A third British species is the Wood Cricket (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nemolicus sylvestris</i>),
which is considerably rarer than either of the preceding. It is
found abundantly among dead leaves in woods in France
and other parts of the Continent, but is very rarely found in
England.</p>

<p>The Mole Cricket (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gryllotalpa vulgaris</i>) is perhaps the most
interesting member of the family. It is a large, robust insect,
about an inch and a half in length and of a very dark brown
colour. It is remarkable for the peculiar shape of its front legs,
which exactly resemble those of the mole.</p>

<p>It burrows in loose soil, and, like the mole, it passes along close
beneath the surface of the ground, and often raises a small ridge
as it advances. It frequents gardens, especially near the banks
of canals, and is also fond of damp meadows and other localities
in the vicinity of water.</p>

<p>The eggs to the number of 200 or 300, are deposited in a
chamber of considerable dimensions, and enclosed in a sort of
cocoon-like envelope.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> when first hatched are white, and are said to be
three years in arriving at a state of maturity. The mole cricket
is found chiefly in the south of England.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_060.jpg" width="200" height="284" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 72.&mdash;&OElig;canthus Pellucens.</div>
</div>

<p><a id="FAM5E"></a><i>Family 5, Gryllid√¶.</i>&mdash;The most conspicuous insect belonging
to this family in Britain is known as the great Green Grasshopper
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phasgonura viridissima</i>), which measures nearly four inches in
expanse of the wing, and is therefore nearly as large as the
migratory locust which sometimes visits us.</p>

<p>The great green grasshopper is not, however, a very common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
insect in this country, being principally confined to the south of
the island.</p>

<p>Another European and British species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Decticus verrucivorus</i>, is
of about the same length. It receives its name from the custom
prevailing among the Swedish peasants of making it bite their
warts. This insect, in common with many others of the same
family, when at all roughly handled, emits from the mouth a
brownish fluid, which is said to possess acrid qualities, and the
introduction of this into the warts is supposed to cause their
disappearance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_061.jpg" width="500" height="498" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 73.&mdash;Truxalis Nasuta.</div>
</div>

<p><a id="FAM6E"></a><i>Family 6, Locustid√¶.</i>&mdash;This family, which includes the grasshoppers
and true locusts, is easily distinguished from both the
preceding families by the character of the antenn√¶, which are comparatively
short.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The common English Grasshopper (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rhammatocerus biguttulus</i>),
whose song must be familiar to every one who has walked through
the fields during the summer time, is produced by the friction of
the hinder thighs against the wing-cases.</p>

<p>The locusts have been celebrated from the dawn of history on
account of the terrible ravages which they have committed in
various parts of the world; and although many different species
have made their appearance in our own country at various times,
the climate, fortunately, seems unsuitable for them to live in, and
they have, therefore, not been known to breed here.</p>

<p>The Migratory Locust (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">√Üdipoda migratoria</i>) is perhaps the best
known in this country on account of its visits, many stray individuals
of which have visited us at different periods.</p>

<p>Locusts are known all the world over, in fact, nearly every
country has a species peculiar to itself. The most extraordinary
accounts are on record of the vastness of the swarms which every
now and again invade particular districts. They are said sometimes
to absolutely darken the sun.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>They clear off everything from the surface of the ground as
completely as if the place had been visited by fire.</p>

<p>In many eastern countries locusts are relished as articles of
food.</p>

<p>The distinctive character of the insects comprised in this group
is found in the structure of the wings. The anterior pair are of
a horny or leathery consistence, but always much shorter than the
abdomen. The hind wings, on the contrary, are of large size, and
are composed of a very delicate membrane. There is only one
family.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 76.&mdash;Caloptenus Italicus.</div>

<h3><a id="EUPLE"></a><span class="smcap">Tribe III.&mdash;Euplexoptera.</span></h3>

<p><a id="FAM7E"></a><i>Family 7, Forficulid√¶.</i>&mdash;The insects of this family present a great
uniformity of structure. They are, for the most part, of nocturnal
habits, concealing themselves during the day in crevices under the
bark of trees, or in the ground under stones and leaves, etc.</p>

<p>Their food consists almost exclusively of vegetable substances,
and are sometimes very injurious to flowers and fruit.</p>

<p>It has been said, however, that they also feed largely on plant lice
or aphides, which, if true, give them a very redeeming quality.</p>

<p>The female earwig deposits her eggs under a stone in some
cavity in the ground often dug out by her own labour.</p>

<p>Unlike most other insects, the female does not perish as soon
as she has laid her eggs, but lives to behold her offspring, brooding
over them almost like a hen. But it is distressing to learn
that if the mother should die she is immediately devoured by her
progeny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Euplexoptera</i> are widely distributed over the surface of the
earth. The tropical regions, however, can hardly claim any great
predominance over more temperate climates as regards either the
number or size of the species.</p>

<p>The largest European species (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Forficesita gigantea</i>), which is an
inhabitant of some parts of England, measures about an inch in
length of the body.</p>

<p>Our common Earwig (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Forficula auricularia</i>) is not only found all
over Europe, but apparently throughout the greater part of the
eastern hemisphere.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_064.jpg" width="150" height="267" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 77.&mdash;Forficula Auricularia.</div>
</div>

<p>Another British species, viz., the little Earwig (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Labia minor</i>), is
also of wide distribution.</p>

<p>The earwig derives its name from its occasionally creeping into
the human ear in search of concealment. This has been denied
by many authors, but we have personally known instances of earwigs
entering the ears of persons lying asleep in fields in the
summer time. The insect can be driven out immediately by pouring
a little oil into the ear.</p>

<p>Some writers have attempted to prove that the name earwig is
a corruption of "earwing," in allusion to the shape of the hind
wings; really a very ingenious idea, but incorrect nevertheless.</p>

Spits, Froghoppers, Plant Lice, and many other familiar forms. The
three great divisions into which they are divided are treated by
many entomologists as distinct orders. The following will show
under each heading the principal distinguishing character of each
group or sub-order as we shall designate them.</p>

<p class="hi"><a href="#HETEROPTERA"><i>Sub-Order 1, Heteroptera.</i></a>&mdash;Fore wings of a parchment like
consistency.</p>

<p class="hi"><a href="#HOMOPTERA"><i>Sub-Order 2, Homoptera.</i></a>&mdash;Fore wings membranous and
naked, similar to the hind ones.</p>

<p class="hi"><a href="#ANOPLURA"><i>Sub-Order 3, Anaplura.</i></a>&mdash;Wingless; no metamorphosis.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Heteroptera</i> are regarded as the highest of the three groups,
followed by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Homoptera</i>, while the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anoplura</i> constitute a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
somewhat aberrant series, and are somewhat in the same position
as the fleas (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aphaniptera</i>) are to the true <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diptera</i>.</p>

<h3><a id="HETEROPTERA"></a>SUB-ORDER I.&mdash;HETEROPTERA.</h3>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Heteroptera</i> constitute the first sub-order of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hemiptera</i>.
They include the True Bugs, an extensive group of very varied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
structure and habits. The greater part of the terrestrial species
feed on plants, though some feed on the blood of animals, while
the aquatic species are principally carnivorous in their habits.
This sub-order is divided into two tribes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_068a.jpg" width="250" height="333" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 80.&mdash;Graphosoma Lineatum (Mag.)</div>
</div>


<h4><a id="GEOCORES"></a><span class="smcap">Tribe I.&mdash;Geocores or Land Bugs.</span></h4>

<p>This tribe includes the terrestrial species of bugs. It is subdivided
into fifteen families.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_068b.jpg" width="200" height="267" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 81.&mdash;Tectocoris Banksii.</div>
</div>

<p><a id="FAM1F"></a><i>Family 1, Scutellerid√¶.</i>&mdash;This extensive family includes the
greater portion of the largest and handsomest species of the Land
Bugs.</p>

<p>The insects live upon plants, trees, and shrubs, and feed upon
the juices, which they suck out of the soft tissues, many of them
especially attacking juicy fruits. The family is very well represented
in the warmer parts of the world, where also the most
beautifully coloured species are met with.</p>

<p>One of the most handsome representatives in Europe is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Graphosoma
lineatum</i>, which measures nearly half an inch in length. It
is reddish in colour and is common on flowers, especially those of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Umbellifer√¶</i>, but is not met with in our own country.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Edessa cervus</i> is a native of South America, and another pretty
species.</p>

<p>The most familiar British species is what is commonly known
as the Colewort Bug (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Strachia oleracea</i>), a very pretty insect,
which lives on cruciferous plants, and is said sometimes to be
injurious in gardens.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 83.&mdash;Euthyrhynchus Floridanus (Mag.)</div>
</div>

<p>Some of the Chinese Bugs belonging to the genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tesseratoma</i>
are the largest species known.</p>

<p><a id="FAM2F"></a><i>Family 2, Coreid√¶.</i>&mdash;This family contains a great number of
plant-feeding native and exotic species, varying considerably in
shape and structure. The majority of European species are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
however, of small size in comparison to those found in tropical
parts of the world.</p>

<p>The insects of this family are rarely adorned with bright
colours, different shades of brown being the prevailing tints,
although a few of them are gaily adorned.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_070a.jpg" width="250" height="370" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 84.&mdash;Trigonosoma Desfontainei.</div>
</div>

<p>In their general habits they much resemble the Shield Bugs.</p>

<p>Two British species are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Syromastes marginatus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Verlusia
rhombea</i>.</p>

<p><a id="FAM3F"></a><i>Family 3, Lyg√¶id√¶.</i>&mdash;The members of this family are, on the
whole, much smaller than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coreid√¶</i>, some of the smallest
forms of which many of them resemble.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_070b.jpg" width="200" height="348" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 85.&mdash;Cantao Oceliatus (Mag.)</div>
</div>

<p>These insects are generally of a red colour, with black bands
and spots.</p>

<p>Several species are very injurious to cultivated plants. One of
the most destructive of all is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Blissus leucopterus</i>, a black insect
with white fore wings, each of which is marked with a large black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
triangular spot on the outer edge. It measures about an eighth
of an inch in length. The young larva is red. In the United
States this insect, which abounds to a considerable extent, is
called the "Chinch Bug."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p><a id="FAM4F"></a><i>Family 4, Pyrrhocorid√¶.</i>&mdash;This family of bugs abounds in all
parts of the world, and in Europe and Britain is undoubtedly the
most numerously represented of all the families of bugs. A very
common species in this country found on nettles is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phytocoris
tripustulatus</i>, which is about one-sixth of an inch in length, and
generally yellowish in colour.</p>

<p><a id="FAM5F"></a><i>Family 5, Capsid√¶.</i>&mdash;This family contains a great number of
small species of variegated colours, which feed exclusively on the
sap of plants or the juice of fruits.</p>

<p>A rather small species (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Capsus ater</i>) is common upon herbage.
The male is entirely black; in the female the head and thorax
are reddish. The genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Miris</i> and its allies include elongated
species, which are found chiefly in grassy places.</p>

<p><a id="FAM6F"></a><i>Family 6, Tingidid√¶.</i>&mdash;The species of this family differ considerably
among themselves in size, structure, and habits; and
although the majority of them are carnivorous, others, especially
among the smaller species, are herbivorous. One species
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tingis pyri</i>), found in our own country, is sometimes very
injurious to pear trees.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 89.&mdash;Cimex Lectularius (Mag.)</div>
</div>

<p><a id="FAM7F"></a><i>Family 7, Cimicid√¶.</i>&mdash;The type of this family is the common
Bed Bug (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acanthia lectularia</i>), which is only too well known to
most people. Although treated as a British insect, it does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
always appear to have been an inhabitant of these islands, but to
have made its way here about the beginning of the sixteenth
century. Three other British species have been described as
inhabiting the dwelling-places of certain animals and sucking their
blood. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. columbaria</i> attacks pigeons. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. hirundinis</i> is found
in swallows' nests, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. pipistrelli</i> feeds on bats.</p>

<p><a id="FAM8F"></a><i>Family 8, Reduviid√¶.</i>&mdash;All the insects of this family are predaceous
in their habits, and are exceedingly numerous in tropical
climates. The largest British species is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Reduvius personatus</i>, an
insect about three-quarters of an inch long, of a blackish-brown
colour with reddish legs. It is well furnished with wings, and
flies especially in warm summer evenings, when it frequently enters
houses, being attracted by the lights. This insect is said to be a
great enemy to the bed bug.</p>

<p>Some of the foreign species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Reduviid√¶</i> are most formidable
insects, such as the great black <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Conorrhinus renggeri</i> of Chili,
which often attacks travellers when camping out.</p>

<p><a id="FAM9F"></a><i>Family 9, Emesid√¶.</i>&mdash;Most of these insects are carnivorous in
their habits. The best known species of this family is probably
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pl√¶aria vagabunda</i>, a brown, delicately-formed insect, which
inhabits trees.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 90.&mdash;Acanthaspis Sexguttata.</div>
</div>


<h4><a id="HYDRO"></a><span class="smcap">Tribe II.&mdash;Hydrocores or Water Bugs.</span></h4>

<p>All the insects belonging to this tribe are either water insects,
or found only in the immediate neighbourhood of water. It
contains the remaining families of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Heteroptera</i>, six in number.</p>

<p><a id="FAM10F"></a><i>Family 10, Saldid√¶.</i>&mdash;The majority of species belonging to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
family are small, dull-coloured insects, always found in the
neighbourhood, though they are not strictly aquatic.</p>

<p><a id="FAM11F"></a><i>Family 11, Hydrometrid√¶.</i>&mdash;The habits of most of these insects
are herbivorous, and they are all found near water.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hydrometra stagnorum</i> is a black or brown insect, more or less
tinged with reddish, and about half an inch long. It is found
running on the surface of water, or else on the banks or among
water plants, but is not so active as some of the other species.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_074.jpg" width="300" height="732" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 91.&mdash;Halobates Pictus (Mag.)</div>
</div>

<p><a id="FAM12F"></a><i>Family 12, Gerrid√¶.</i>&mdash;This family includes some very familiar
insects, which may be seen running over the surface of every
piece of water. These insects, of which several species are
abundant in Britain, have boat-shaped bodies. The typical form
is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gerris lacustris</i>, which may be met with almost anywhere.
They are predaceous in their habits, feeding upon other insects.
Some nearly allied, but mostly very small species, with legs even
longer in proportion than those of our common forms, are met
with at sea within the tropics, and often at a great distance from
land.</p>

<p><a id="FAM13F"></a><i>Family 13, Galgulid√¶.</i>&mdash;This family only includes a few
American species, which are generally brown spotted with yellow.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Galgulus oculatus</i> inhabits the southern part of the United States,
and measures about two-fifths of an inch in length.</p>

<p><a id="FAM14F"></a><i>Family 14, Nepid√¶.</i>&mdash;The species of this family are not very
numerous, but are of considerable interest. They are of large
size, and very fierce and voracious. The genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Betostoma</i>, found
in the East Indies and America, includes the largest species of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Heteroptera</i>, some of which measure four and a half inches in
length, and nearly six inches in expanse of the wing. Their food
consists of small fish, frogs, etc.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 93.&mdash;Nepa Cinerea.</div>
</div>

<p>The best-known species in our own country is the Water
Scorpion (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nepa cinerea</i>), which has the power of inflicting a very
painful wound if handled. It measures about an inch in length.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
In colour it is yellowish-grey, the back of the abdomen being red,
and its large front legs, which somewhat resemble the claws of a
scorpion, have given rise to the name by which it is popularly
known. It is very common in stagnant water.</p>

but make up for their individual insignificance by their immense
numbers.</p>

<p>They sometimes exist in countless millions, completely smothering
the plants upon which they feed.</p>

<p>Migratory habits seem to be strongly developed among the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aphid√¶</i>, hence it is we are so suddenly visited by such enormous
quantities of the insects during hot weather in the summer time.</p>

<p>In colour the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aphides</i> are generally green, brown, and black,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>

<span class="smcap">Including the Gnats, Midges, Crane Flies, Hawk Flies,
Bee Flies, Breeze Flies, Bot Flies, and their Allies.</span></h2>


<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diptera</i>, or two-winged flies, are among the most numerous
orders of insects, but they have been so little studied hitherto that
we have but a very imperfect knowledge of them, especially as
regards the tropical species.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_087.jpg" width="500" height="393" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 120.&mdash;Midas Giganteus.</div>
</div>

<p>The number recorded in the British Isles is about 3,000, that
of the whole world probably exceeds 30,000, and it is certain that
this number will be increased immensely as time goes on.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diptera</i> may be defined as insects with a sucking mouth
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Haustellate</i>), and with only two wings, which are membranous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
while the hind wings are represented only by a pair of small
knotted organs, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">halteres</i>. Their metamorphoses are complete.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> are footless "grubs," generally with a soft body, but
sometimes leathery or even nearly horny. Many of them possess
a distinctly marked head, which may contain <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ocelli</i>, but in the
majority the head appears as if it were simply one of the neighbouring
segments.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_088.jpg" width="500" height="321" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 121.&mdash;Craspedia Coriaria.</div>
</div>

<p>Their food generally consists of decayed animal and vegetable
matter, and thus they are very useful as scavengers, particularly in
hot climates.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> frequently live in the substance upon which they
feed, while others reside in water, and many are parasitic.</p>

<p>For the classification of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diptera</i> we owe much to that
eminent entomologist, Osten-Sacken, whose arrangement has been
here generally adopted.</p>

<h3><a id="NEMO"></a><span class="smcap">Tribe I.&mdash;Nemocera.</span></h3>

<p>This tribe contains many well-known insects&mdash;namely, the
Midges, Gnats, Daddy-longlegs, etc., which are divided into twelve
families.</p>

<p><a id="FAM1I"></a><i>Family 1, Cecidomyiid√¶.</i>&mdash;These are small delicate species,
generally clothed with long hair. They are all vegetable feeders,
some of them being very destructive to crops. The Hessian Fly
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cecidomyia destructor</i>) is probably one of the best-known species,
on account of the terrible mischief which it has caused in various
countries, and particularly in the United States of America. Miss
E. A. Ormerod, the well-known economic entomologist, has
recently written a great deal concerning this insect, with the view
to preventing its increase in our own country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The Wheat Midge (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diplosis tritici</i>) is another very mischievous
species.</p>

<p><a id="FAM3I"></a><i>Family 3, Simuliid√¶.</i>&mdash;This family includes only one genus,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Simulium</i>.</p>

<p>It is, however, widely distributed, and some of the species,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>

are very familiar insects. Among them is the St. Mark's Fly (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bibio
Marci</i>), which is black, with transparent wings in the male and brownish in the female.</p>

<p>These flies appear in the spring, and their <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> live in dung
or damp earth.</p>

<p>Many of the species are popularly called "garden flies."</p>

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">antenn√¶</i> are usually long and slender, and the wings broad and
long. The type of this family is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Blepharicera fasciata</i>, the female
of which is a very blood-thirsty creature. It is a dark brown fly,
with transparent wings and yellow legs, and it measures about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
one-third of an inch in length. It is, however, by no means
abundant.</p>

<p><a id="FAM6I"></a><i>Family 6, Culicid√¶.</i>&mdash;The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Culicid√¶</i>, or Gnats, are a very

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> are nearly all aquatic.</p>

<p>They are generally small, dull-coloured insects, and are often
called "Mosquitoes" in the country. These insects frequently
cause much annoyance during the summer months to persons
engaged in out-door occupations. They are particularly abundant
in damp meadows, in the vicinity of water, and also in hay-fields,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
where the face and hands of the mowers are sometimes blistered
to much pain by the suckers of the little creatures.</p>

<p><a id="FAM7I"></a><i>Family 7, Chironomid√¶.</i>&mdash;These insects are small delicate
insects, much resembling gnats in appearance, and are popularly
called "Midges." The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> of most of the species are aquatic.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larva</i> of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chironomus plumosus</i>, which is common in
stagnant water, is called the "blood worm" from its bright red
colour.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 131.&mdash;Tipula Gigantea.</div>
</div>

<p><a id="FAM8I"></a><i>Family 8, Orphnephilid√¶.</i>&mdash;Most of the species belonging to
this family are of small size.</p>

<p>The typical species is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Orphnephelia testacea</i>, measuring scarcely
one-tenth of an inch in length, and is sometimes found in bakehouses.
It is of a rusty-yellow colour.</p>

<p><a id="FAM9I"></a><i>Family 9, Psychodid√¶.</i>&mdash;This is a small family consisting of
minute brown or yellowish species remarkable for their resemblance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>

substances.</p>

<p>The species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phlebotomus</i> are troublesome blood-suckers in
the south of Europe.</p>

<p><a id="FAM10I"></a><i>Family 10, Tipulid√¶.</i>&mdash;The insects belonging to this group are
popularly known as Crane Flies and Daddy-longlegs. They are
very abundant.</p>

<p>The commonest species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tipula oleracea</i>, is a grey species with
transparent wings, and exceedingly destructive to corn, roots of
grass, etc., and no effectual remedy has hitherto been discovered
for preventing their attacks.</p>

<p>The familiar Winter Gnat (<i>Trichocera hiemalis</i>) belongs to this
family. It may often be seen, even during the dreary months of
December and January, dancing to and fro under the shelter of
some hedge or wall. In frosty weather it conceals itself beneath
the bark of trees, under leaves, etc.</p>

<p><a id="FAM11I"></a><i>Family 11, Dixid√¶.</i>&mdash;This family of gnats frequents damp
places in woods, and are therefore designated "Wood Gnats."
They may occasionally be seen during the summer time in
immense swarms.</p>

<p>The species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dixa</i> are reddish, yellow, or black insects
generally of small size.</p>

<p><a id="FAM12I"></a><i>Family 12, Rhyphid√¶.</i>&mdash;The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> of most of these insects feed
upon decayed vegetable matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rhyphus</i> may often be found resting on leaves
in damp situations, they may also be seen on windows, and
occasionally "dancing in the air."</p>

<p>They are generally brown, yellow, or grey insects of small
size.</p>


<h3><a id="BRACHY"></a><span class="smcap">Tribe II.&mdash;Brachycera.</span></h3>

<p><a id="FAM14I"></a><i>Family 14, C&oelig;nomyiid√¶.</i>&mdash;In this family the head is narrower
than the thorax; otherwise they closely resemble the previous
family. The typical European species is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C&oelig;nomyia ferruginea</i>,
which measures about three-quarters of an inch in length, and in
colour varies from rusty-yellow to black. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> feed inside
the trunks of rotten poplars.</p>

<p><a id="FAM15I"></a><i>Family 15, Stratiomyiid√¶.</i>&mdash;These are rather slender flies, varying
from half to one inch in length. They are usually found resting
on low plants. Many species frequent cow-dung and manure, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Several kinds exhibit a metallic coloration, others are black, often
more or less varied with white or yellow.</p>

<p><a id="FAM16I"></a><i>Family 16, Acanthomerid√¶.</i>&mdash;The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acanthomerid√¶</i> are met with
principally in America. The typical species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acanthomera picta</i>,
is found in Brazil, and measures more than an inch in length. It
used formerly to be largely used in the manufacture of pomade.</p>

<p><a id="FAM17I"></a><i>Family 17, Tabanid√¶.</i>&mdash;The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tabanid√¶</i> are broad-looking
insects. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> usually live in damp earth. The females of
these species live on the blood of animals.</p>

<p>The best-known species is the Gad Fly (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tabanus bovinus</i>), which
measures more than an inch in length, and is particularly troublesome
to cattle in hot weather. It is blackish above, and reddish
beneath and on the sides of the abdomen.</p>

<p>The Clegg Fly (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H√¶matopota pluvialis</i>) also belongs to this family.

<p><a id="FAM19I"></a><i>Family 19, Asilid√¶.</i>&mdash;The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Asilid√¶</i> or Hawk Flies are a family
of considerable extent, and include many very large and conspicuous
insects. They feed on other insects, and are very courageous, sometimes
attacking even dragon flies. One of the most common
species is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Asilus crabroniformis</i>, which is common in the south of
England.</p>

<p><a id="FAM20I"></a><i>Family 20, Midaid√¶.</i>&mdash;These are large insects resembling the

<p><a id="FAM22I"></a><i>Family 22, Bombyliid√¶.</i>&mdash;The Bee Flies belong to this family.
They are small or middle-sized insects, densely clothed with hairs.
They are exceedingly active insects with long tongues, with which
they suck honey from flowers. Their <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> are often parasitic in
their earlier stages on other insects.</p>

<p>They are very useful in North America by keeping down the
number of locusts, in the egg capsules of which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> feed.</p>

<p>Two species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bombyliis major</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">B. medius</i>, are common in this
country, and may often be seen in gardens and open spaces in
woods during the spring and summer months.</p>

<p><a id="FAM23I"></a><i>Family 23, Therevid√¶.</i>&mdash;This family is a very numerous one,
especially those of the typical genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thereva</i>. They are slender,
middle-sized black insects, and their bodies are generally covered
with hair. They are generally found in the neighbourhood of
bushes and trees.</p>

<p>Most of the species may be recognised at once by their peculiar
mode of flight, for they hover motionless in the air, and if
alarmed dart off with a rapid motion which the eye cannot follow.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Milesia Crabroniformis</i> is a very large species common in the

wasp. It is a very useful insect, feeding largely on aphides and
plant lice, and should therefore be encouraged by every
horticulturist.</p>

<p><a id="FAM30I"></a><i>Family 30, Conopid√¶.</i>&mdash;The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> of most of these insects are
parasitic on <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Orthoptera</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hymenoptera</i>. Many species have a

<p><a id="FAM33I"></a><i>Family 33, √Üstrid√¶.</i>&mdash;The Bot Flies are well known on account
of the annoyance they cause to cattle. They lay their eggs upon
the hides of the animals, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i>, when hatched, make their
way under the skin, and there take up their abode, living on the
juices of their unfortunate host. It is estimated that the loss
occasioned by these troublesome pests amounts to millions of
pounds in the British Isles alone. The best-known species is probably
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">√Üstrus bovis</i>, which infests the ox. The cattle are so well
aware of the danger attending the presence of this insect, that as
soon as it appears near them, the whole herd exhibits the most
unmistakable signs of terror, rushing about their pasture with
their tails in the air, and in case of need taking refuge in water,
where the fly will not follow them. Miss E. A. Ormerod has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
recently paid much attention to the economy of this insect, with
the view to finding some remedy for its attacks.</p>

<p><a id="FAM34I"></a><i>Family 34, Muscid√¶.</i>&mdash;The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Muscid√¶</i> is the most numerous
family, of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diptera</i> and it includes many familiar insects. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
divided into two sections, containing thirteen sub-families. The
first section, <a id="CALYP"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calypter√¶</i>, contains five sub-families. The <a id="SF1E"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tachinin√¶</i>
are parasitic in the larval stage on <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lepidoptera</i>. The largest of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Muscid√¶</i> found in Europe is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Echinomyria grossa</i>, which measures
about three-quarters of an inch in length.</p>

<p>Many species of the <a id="SF2E"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dexin√¶</i> are of the most metallic-green or
blue. They are principally found in Australia.</p>

<p>The Flesh Fly (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sarcophaga carnaria</i>) belongs to the <a id="SF3E"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sarcophagin√¶</i>
and is one of our largest species. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> of some species are
called "Screw Worms" in America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The fourth sub-family, the <a id="SF4E"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Muscin√¶</i>, contains the most typical
species of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diptera</i> or two-winged flies. The common House
Fly (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Musca domestica</i>) is the most familiar example. Several blue-and-green
flies are produced from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> which feed on more or
less putrid flesh, and are well known to anglers as "Gentles."
The Blow Fly or Blue Bottle (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Musca vomitoria</i>) is one of these,
also the Green Bottle Fly (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lucilia C√¶sar</i>) which is often common
about hedges in the summer time. Many species belong to the
sub-family <a id="SF5E"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthomyiin√¶</i>, are very small insects, and their <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i>
mine in the leaves of plants like those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tine√¶</i>.</p>

<p>Section 2, namely <a id="ACALYP"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acalypter√¶</i>, contains eight sub-families.</p>

<p>The species of <a id="SF6E"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scalophagin√¶</i> are usually called "Dung-flies."
The commonest species, the Yellow Dung Fly (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scatophaga stercoraria</i>),
feeds largely on manure and other refuse.</p>

<p>The <a id="SF7E"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ortalin√¶</i> are flies of small or moderate size, which are met
with principally in woods and fields. The <a id="SF8E"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trypetin√¶</i> feed chiefly
on fruit. One species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ceratitis hispanica</i>, is very destructive to
oranges in the south of Europe, etc. Of the <a id="SF9E"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Piophilin√¶</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Piophila casei</i>
may be taken as the typical example. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
abound in cheese and bacon are popularly called "Cheese
Hoppers," or "Jumpers," in allusion to their habit of springing.
The <a id="SF10E"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diopsin√¶</i> are principally met with in the tropical parts of the
world. They are generally insects of moderate size. Most of the
species of <a id="SF11E"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chloropin√¶</i> are of small size. Their <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> generally live in
the stems of corn and various kinds of grasses. The <a id="SF12E"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Drosophilin√¶</i>
are small, dull-coloured flies, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larv√¶</i> of which feed on fungi,
rotten fruit, and similar substances.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 152.&mdash;Hypoderma Bovis (Mag.)</div>
</div>

<p>The last sub-family, namely, the <a id="SF13E"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agromyzin√¶</i>, is very extensive.
One of the commonest species is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phytomyza ilicis</i>, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larva</i> of
which forms large brown blotches on the leaves of the holly.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 153.&mdash;Diopsis Subfasciata (Mag.)</div>
</div>

<p><a id="FAM35I"></a><i>Family 35, Phorid√¶.</i>&mdash;The insects belonging to this family are
generally of small or moderate size. They are very active, and
may be observed on plants, and also sometimes sunning themselves
on windows.</p>


<h3><a id="HOMALOP"></a><span class="smcap">Tribe III.&mdash;Homaloptera.</span></h3>

<p>The insects belonging to this section much resemble spiders
in appearance. They are all parasitic, and are remarkable for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
perfect insect producing its young singly, and that not in the egg
state, as in most insects, but either in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pupa</i> state, or as a
mature <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">larva</i> ready to become a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pupa</i> immediately. This tribe
contains only three families.</p>

<p><a id="FAM36I"></a><i>Family 36, Hippoboscid√¶.</i>&mdash;The most familiar insects comprised
in this family are known as "Forest Flies." The common Forest
Fly (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hippobosca equina</i>) is a brown species about one-third of an
inch in length, and exceedingly annoying to horses, particularly in
the New Forest. The Sheep Tick (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melophagus ovinus</i>) is another
well-known example.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 154.&mdash;Oscinis Cornuta (Mag.)</div>
</div>

<p><a id="FAM37I"></a><i>Family 37, Nycteribid√¶.</i>&mdash;These insects are all parasitic on
bats, and are commonly known as "Bat Lice." They are wingless,
but have a pair of halteres placed upon the dorsal surface.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 155.&mdash;Phora Camariana (Mag.)</div>
</div>

<p><a id="FAM38I"></a><i>Family 38, Braulid√¶.</i>&mdash;This family includes only a single species,
which is parasitic upon the honey bee. Its name is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Braula c√¶ca</i>,
and it is an exceedingly minute creature.</p>


<h3><a id="APHAN"></a><span class="smcap">Tribe IV.&mdash;Aphaniptera.</span></h3>

<p>The tribe <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aphaniptera</i> was formerly considered to be a separate
order, but it is now generally included among the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diptera</i> on
account of the similarity in the transformations besides other
considerations. There is only one family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p><a id="FAM39I"></a><i>Family 39, Pulicid√¶.</i>&mdash;To this family belongs the numerous
species of fleas which infest different kinds of animals.</p>

<p>The Human Flea (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pulex irritans</i>) is familiar to every one. It
gets its living by sucking our blood, and is of great annoyance,
particularly in hot weather. The blisters which it raises on
various parts of the body are exceedingly irritating.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_109.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 156.&mdash;Pulex Irritans (Mag.)</div>
</div>

<p>The Dog Flea (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pulex canis</i>) and the Cat Flea (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pulex felis</i>) are
distinct from the above, and are chiefly confined to those animals,
although they do not disdain to vary their diet occasionally with
human blood.</p>

<p>The Jigger or Chigoe (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sarcopsylla penetrans</i>) is abundant in
the West Indies and in South America. It is sometimes very
annoying to travellers, burrowing deeply under the skin. The
body of the female is capable of attaining to the dimensions of a
pea.</p>
